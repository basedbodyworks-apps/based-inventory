"""Live-SKU filter for ShipHero-sourced alerts.

The bot must skip three classes of SKUs before alerting on quantity tiers
or oversold inventory:

1. Test / cruft / legacy SKUs that exist in ShipHero but aren't real
   live products. Filtered by heuristic name patterns.
2. SKUs Avi has explicitly marked as end-of-life / not-restocking. Lives
   in `data/discontinued-skus.json` and is editable by Avi.
3. Channel / warehouse variant suffixes (-FBA, -CASE, -PALLET) that
   represent the same physical product as another SKU; alerting on
   them duplicates the underlying SKU's signal.

This is the ShipHero analog of the legacy `skip_list.py` (which was
keyed by Shopify product title). The two coexist; both are applied.
